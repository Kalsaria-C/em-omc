# Unsuccessful Food Orders

## Introduction

In this lab, you will understand the concept of Parsers in Logging Analytics.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes.

### Objectives

In this lab you will:

* Understand the meaning of Parsers.
* Create a single-line parser.
* Create a multi-line parser.
* Visualize parsed data in explorer.
* Create alarms for more than 30% unsuccessful orders in 15 mins

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account.

## Task 1: Understand Parsers

A Parser takes raw configuration data and parses it into a nested attribute structure. Each parser consists of a base parser and parser parameters. Some parsers also contain post-parsing rules. A base parser essentially is a category of parser capable of parsing data of a particular format. Parser parameters provide a way to tailor the base format to accommodate variations in data formatting.

Oracle Logging Analytics offers hundreds of Oracle-defined sources and parsers that you can directly use without creating custom ones. To collect logs of a format which doesn't have an Oracle-defined source or parser, you can create custom source or parser.

There are four varieties of base parser:

1. Regex
2. JSON
3. XML
4. Delimited
