## Task 1: Understand a Scheduled Search Detection rule

Detection in Logging Analytics means detecting specific content in the log records. Detection rules are the rules by which we can detect specific content in the log records. Detection rules help you to detect events of your interest and post metrics in OCI Monitoring service. You can do this by creating a detection rule based on the label which is associated with the log record from specific log sources and entity types.

Let's say you want to detect whenever you have an authentication error in your log content, you can do it by creating a detection rule.

**Scheduled search detection rule:** After creating a saved search, you can schedule to run the query in the saved search periodically and route the result of running the query to the Monitoring service using scheduled search detection rule.

## Task 2: Check the Policies
